TASC Wheel with Phases  (GIGD,IECL)
1. Gather/Organise (Tools: Brainstroming, MindMap) (Knowledge, Information, Resources)
2. Identity (Tools: Analysis , Task, Problem, Success Criteria) (Problem Scope and Parameter)
3. Generate (Tools: Brainstroming, Blue Sky Thinking, Lateral Thinking, Metaphors) (Solutions: Possible, Impossible)
4. Decide (Tools: Critical Thinking) (Decide, non-viable: eg time constraints, financial, hr resources)
5. Implement 
6. Evaluate (Tools: Evaluation against success criteria Critical Thinking) (Minimum Level of Performance)
7. Communicate (Tools: Presentation , Report)
8. Learn from experience (Tool: Self Reflection)

Phases
1. Phase 1 & 2 : information
2. Phase 3: creativity (right-brain)
3. Phase 4: criticality (left-brain)
4. Phase 5: implementation (combined)
5. Phase 6: evaluation (critical: left-brain)
6. Phase 7: communication (creative, right-brain)
7. Phase 8: Learn from experience (combined)


Six Hats Overview 
- Ways : Serial and Parallel
- Argument vs Parallel Thinking (individual or sequential) (In serial : one by one)
```
- White - Objective (Left Brain)
- Red   - Emotional (Right)
- Yellow - Optimistic (Right)
- Black  - Critical (Left)
- Green  - Creative (Right)
- Blue   - Control and Overview 
```

```
1. Blue Hat (First or Last), mostly goals
2. White Hat (Facts and Data)
3. Green Hat (Creative Ideas)
4. Yellow Hat (only benefits and values from green hat's ideas)
5. Red Hat (only emotional)
6. Black Hat (Judgement based on logical reasoning)
```

White Hat: is neutral and objective; concerned with facts, figures and proof. (information gathering)
Red Hat : allows an intuitive, emotional response, unconstrained by logic. (Emotional)
Black Hat : is cautious, critical and careful – it looks for weaknesses in an idea.  (Judge : critical judgment)
Yellow Hat : is positive, optimistic and looks for the benefits and ‘up sides’ in any idea (positive)
Green Hat : indicates creativity and new ideas (Creative thinking)
Blue Hat: is cool and detached, concerned with control and organisation of the thinking process. (Decision-making process)

Measurements
- Scientific mesaurement ? 
- Subjective ? 


A scientific measurement is a way of obtaining values which does not depend on who is making the measurement
Objective is exact data


Measurements
Distributions - how often they fall within a given range (binning). By separating ranges into smaller ranges(bins), shows how values vary

Normal Distributions - Bell-shaped, 
Central Value - a number which can be used to summarize a collection of values. 
The Mediam - Sort and Find the point where half the values are smaller and half the values are larger (Order all values and then add only middle values /2)
The Mean - more accurate than the median, for estimating the center of normal distributions.  (Mean = all value + /2)

Uniform Distribution
Discrete - six-sided, perfect dice (Specific value)
Continuous - fire alarm sometime between 12:00 and 14:00 (values between ranges)



Genearted Data
- Simulated Data (generated auto)
- Data Integrity (
- Data Representation  (Format, units, headers)
- Quantitative Data (consists of numbers)  (the type of quantity including units)
- Qualitative Data (types) organizing rather than calculating. Eg., nationality, address
- Discrete Data
- Continuous Data 
- Comparing Data
```
Central Value - Median, Mean
Accuracy of the Mean

Charts
- Histograms - relative frequencies if in a range
- Pie Charts 
- Bar Charts
- Time Series

Topic 10 
Uncertainty
- Statistical error (Like Weather)
- User error
- Systematic error (Not measuring)

Sources of error
- Bias - poor experimental design (initial error, only few data error)
- Noise - changing conditions and interactions with the environment
- Representation of values - rounding error (changing values), transfer error (faulty communication)


Standard Error
- mean ± standard error (spread) : either side of mean
- probability of about 70% close to estimated mean (one standard error)
- probability of about 95% close to estimated mean (two standard error) (*2 multiplied by 2)
- Representative means close to percentage 70%

Combining Errors - standard error = sum of individual standard errors

Dependence - relation between combining data from two randomly varying quantities. Eg., weight and height

Scatter Plots - visualize paired data values (2 data values)


Correlation - weight ~ height (Dependent and relation)
Uncorrelation - no relation 


Using Statistic (summary  of nonsense is still nonsense.)
- Size of dataset (we need size)
- Choosing the results
- No reference to Source 
- Absence of Control Set (no measurement control)
- Correlation Misuse (misused measure)


Histograms 
- Present frequencies of items in bins
- if we have small values bin and then we can easily guess

Frequencies of items in bins/classes
Eg., maxim temp for 30 consecutive days
Eg. 19, 18, 17, 25, 26, 26, 27, 26, 30, 32, 25, 14, 15, 15, 14, 17, 19, 13, 25, 25, 26, 30, 24, 23, 21, 21, 19, 19, 21, 15

Bin (Ranges)                    Frequency
<15                             3
15-19                           10
20-24                           5
25-29                           9
>29                             3


Bar Charts and Pie Charts
- Used for categorical data
- Eg., 40 students, relative frequencies,
  Used for categorical data
  Eg., 40 students

Category  Number    Relative Frequency %
Mango       20      50
Melon       14      35
Orange      4       10
Apple       2       5


Time Series 
- show Changing value with time
-Eg., variation of temp 19, 18,17, 25, 26, 26, 27, 26, 30, 32, 25, 14, 15, 15, 14, 17, 19, 13, 25, 25, 26, 30, 24, 23, 21, 21, 19, 19, 21, 15

Line from graph

y = mx + c

m=(nxy-xy)nx2-(x)2

c=y-mx where y means mean of y and x means mean of x

Least SSE Regression Criterion


Language of Correlation
Sign
r > 0 (+ linear rs)
r = 0 (no linear rs)
r < 0 (- linear rs)

Strength
R2 > 0.8 strong
R2 > 0.5 moderate
R2 > 0.25 weak

Pearson Correlation

0 ≤ r2 ≤ 1, r2 - coefficient of determination
-1 ≤ r ≤ 1, r - Pearson correlation coefficient
```


Spearman Rank Correlation

No Ties and then use equation. But if we dont have rank and then need to do ranking first. (Like 1,2,3)

Do ranking if it’s not giving ranking data

Ties (same rank in a column, same values like OK : 3 times etc) > use mean rank (3+4+5)/3

Example we have same value in column and then the value for ties , will be mean rank ()


Topic 3 >>> Referencing  (Pyan kyi yan)
```
Reference List : is a list of all the sources used in a paper, eassy or assignment. 
NCC Education use - Harvard Style
:give credit to the original author or source of the information, which is important for avoiding plagiarism and maintaining ethical standards in academic

Reference List by ordered alphabetically by author's surname.
- Author's Surname
- Year of Publication
- Title of Sources
- Place of Publication
- Name of Publisher
```

Reference List -2
In-text reference style
(Author, Date: Page Number)
Eg., (Swe, 2021: 8) 

Name, Initial (Year). Title of work. Location of publisher, name of publisher.
- Myint, S (2030). Br title. Singapore, SPH_Media

Reference list style
Name, Initial (Year). Title of work. Location of publisher, name of publisher.


CPD and Life Long Learning 

Continuing Professional Development (CPD)
```
- Recognition that it is necessary for a professional to continually review and update thier skills, knowledge and competencies need to continually reviewed and updated. 
- By engaging in CPD, IT professionals can keep up-to-date with technologies, thereby ensuring that they remain employable. 
Example: courses, seminars, conferences, reading journal articles, 
```

Lifelong Learning
```
It's the idea that learning does not happen only in your youth as preparation for a carerr, but should continue throughout your life with varying levels of formality. 
- To continually improve one's self/knowledge
Example: Playing chess helps develop problem solving skills.
