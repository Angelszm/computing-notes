Model=m
End Function

Queue - FIFO 
Stack - LIFO 
List - add data in End of array 

Queue operates as First In First Out (FIFO) data structure, data element add to the tail of the array and data remove at the head of the array.
Stack operates as Last in First Out (LIFO) data structure, data push at the top of the array and data pop at the top of the array.
In a List data structure, data add at the end of the array and data retrieve at any position of the array with given index value and list can grow its size as needed.
```


Q4

Q7
(a)(i) 
```
Linear search start the first element of the array and continue one after another until reach the end of the array to search the require item.
```
```
average case for linear search is actually (n+1)/2 searches
```
(b) 
```
